Web development 

The process of building and maintaining websites and web applications that run on the internet. It includes everything from designing the user interface to creating the logic that processes data and makes the website function. Web development is divided into two main parts: front-end development, which focuses on how a site looks and interacts with users using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; and back-end development, which focuses on server logic, databases, and APIs using languages like Python, PHP, or Node.js. Full-stack developers work on both sides. Web development is important because it helps businesses and individuals create online platforms, improve accessibility, support communication, and provide digital services to users worldwide.



Frontend development is the part of web development that focuses on what users see and interact with in a web application. It involves creating the layout, design, buttons, menus, text, images, and overall user interface using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frontend developers ensure that websites are visually appealing, responsive on different devices, and easy for users to navigate. They also handle user interactions, animations, and communication with the backend through APIs. The main goal of frontend development is to provide a smooth, attractive, and user-friendly experience on the web.


Backend development is the part of web development that handles the server-side logic, databases, and all the processes that happen behind the scenes of a website or application. It involves writing code that manages data, processes requests, authenticates users, and connects the frontend with the server and database. Backend developers use languages and technologies like Python, Java, PHP, Node.js, SQL, and various frameworks to build secure, efficient, and scalable systems. The main goal of backend development is to ensure that the application works correctly, stores and retrieves data, and supports all the features the frontend displays to users.


A database is an organized collection of data that is stored, managed, and accessed electronically. It allows applications to save, update, retrieve, and delete information efficiently. Databases are essential in web and mobile applications because they store user accounts, product details, messages, transactions, and any other structured data the system needs. Databases use a Database Management System (DBMS) to control how data is stored and accessed, ensuring security, speed, and reliability. They can be relational (using tables and SQL) or non-relational (using documents, key-value pairs, or graphs), depending on the type of data and the system’s needs.
