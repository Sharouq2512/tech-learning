Web development 

The process of building and maintaining websites and web applications that run on the internet. It includes everything from designing the user interface to creating the logic that processes data and makes the website function. Web development is divided into two main parts: front-end development, which focuses on how a site looks and interacts with users using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; and back-end development, which focuses on server logic, databases, and APIs using languages like Python, PHP, or Node.js. Full-stack developers work on both sides. Web development is important because it helps businesses and individuals create online platforms, improve accessibility, support communication, and provide digital services to users worldwide.
