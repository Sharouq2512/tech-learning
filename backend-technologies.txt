Node.js, Python, and PHP are popular backend technologies used to build the server side of web applications.

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server. It is known for its speed, real-time capabilities, and ability to handle many connections at once, making it great for chat apps, APIs, and streaming platforms.

Python is a powerful and easy-to-read programming language widely used in web development, data science, automation, and AI. With frameworks like Django and Flask, Python helps developers build secure, scalable, and clean backend systems quickly.

PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development. It powers many websites and platforms and integrates smoothly with databases. Frameworks like Laravel make PHP development fast, secure, and efficient.

Together, these technologies allow developers to build strong, dynamic, and functional backends for modern web applications.
