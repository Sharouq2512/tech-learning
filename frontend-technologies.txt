**HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** are the three core technologies used to build the frontend of websites and web applications.

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the structure of a webpage. It defines the content—such as text, images, buttons, and forms—and organizes everything in a logical layout.

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** controls the design and appearance of the webpage. It adds colors, fonts, spacing, layouts, animations, and makes the website responsive on different screen sizes.

**JavaScript (JS)** brings the website to life by adding interactivity and dynamic behavior. It handles actions like clicking buttons, opening menus, validating forms, animations, and communicating with the backend through APIs.

Together, **HTML builds**, **CSS styles**, and **JavaScript powers** the interactive experience users see on the web.


React and Vue are modern JavaScript frameworks used to build interactive and efficient user interfaces on the web.

React is a component-based library created by Facebook. It allows developers to build reusable UI components and manage dynamic content efficiently using a virtual DOM. React is widely used in large applications because it offers high performance, strong community support, and flexibility to integrate with many tools and libraries.

Vue is a progressive JavaScript framework known for its simplicity and ease of learning. It provides a clean structure for building user interfaces and integrates smoothly into existing projects. Vue is also component-based and uses a virtual DOM, offering great performance while being more beginner-friendly.

Together, React and Vue help developers build fast, interactive, and scalable frontend applications with clean and reusable components.
